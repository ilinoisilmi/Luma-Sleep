# Feature status and capability matrix

**Implemented** below means source is present and connected to a real native control. It does not mean an iOS build or hardware behavior was verified. Core calculations have executable regression coverage; all Apple-framework behavior still needs Mac/device acceptance.

## Tracking methods

| Method | Hardware / permission | Background and lifecycle | Battery / storage | Implementation and verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Health | iPhone Health store; sleep-read consent; HealthKit-signed scheme | Foreground anchored queries; processes additions and deletions; wearable delivery can be delayed; no continuous/background query promise | Low, incremental pages; full local JSON commits | Real HealthKit adapter; no live Health store tested. Read refusal cannot be distinguished from absent data. Third-party route is wearable app → Apple Health → Luma |
| Manual diary | Any supported iPhone; no permission | Offline; atomic persistent storage; revision history and undo | Low | Full editor, dates, awakenings, naps, quality, notes and tags; core model tested, native controls unrun |
| Bedtime session | Any supported iPhone; no permission | Persisted start timestamp survives termination; foreground display derives elapsed time; morning review needed | Very low while idle | Start/end, nap timer, stale-session discard and review; serialization recovery tested |
| Motion-assisted review | Supported motion coprocessor; Motion & Fitness consent | Queries at most seven days of stored activity; no overnight stream; last event is not extrapolated | Low, a foreground query | Real Core Motion adapter; suggestions are unconfirmed in-bed evidence until reviewed; no mattress mode; untested on hardware |
| Sound events | Microphone consent; explicit start; audio background mode | Screen lock supported by the chosen session type; interruption/route change stops; termination cannot restart recording | Continuous microphone costs battery; event-only by default; opt-in full AAC recording, 12h / 400MB limits | Real AVAudioEngine + RMS threshold adapter; no snore classifier. Device lifecycle, energy and storage behavior unverified |
| CSV / JSON | Files access through document picker | Foreground preview and atomic import | Up to 10 MB / 20,000 rows per import | Parser, offset checks, timezone validation, duplicates, conflict rejection, examples and exports; core regression tests pass |

## Product features

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Five destinations, midnight/light themes, app icon | Implemented. Icon visually inspected; native screens not rendered |
| History and corrections | Daily/weekly/monthly selection; source detail; corrections and hidden-entry restoration; immutable original diary revisions |
| Overlaps and source priority | Interval sweep counts sleep once; corrections always first, user priority next; same-source awake outranks sleep; unknown gaps excluded |
| Stage timeline | Only actual or explicitly imported stage categories; diary stays unspecified; unknown future Health categories skipped |
| Efficiency | Shown only with bed evidence containing every counted sleep segment; no assumed bedtime |
| Shortfall | Sum of nonnegative daily deficits over 14 days with data; missing days excluded; naps counted once; extra hours never mechanically repay another day |
| Energy curve | Explicitly preliminary planning heuristic after three recorded days; no scientific validation or physiological measurement claim |
| Habit comparisons | At least three tagged and three untagged main-sleep diary entries; sample sizes; association only; split-sleep confounding disclosed |
| Planning | Weekday/weekend wake times, wind-down and settling; fixed-date alternative for irregular schedules |
| Reminders | Wind-down, bedtime, one optional habit notification; manually Apply after schedule changes; Focus/silent delivery limits explained |
| Wake alarm | AlarmKit on iOS 26+; fixed alarm, no countdown UI or smart wake. Older OS directs user to Clock. No alarm delivery tested |
| Shortcuts | Start bedtime, end with morning review, log estimated nap; deliberately opens app; not promised to run silently when locked |
| Widget | LumaHealth only; matching App Group; opt-in target and wind-down sharing; no health history or notes; device refresh cadence unverified |
| Privacy / backups | Offline local container; iOS file protection; excluded automatic backup; explicit JSON/CSV export, restore preview, pre-restore rollback file, deletion controls |
| Demo | Separate in-memory snapshot, conspicuous banner; Health/motion/audio/scheduling actions blocked |
| Architecture | Feature folders; pure core package; source/storage/clock interfaces; deterministic Xcode generator; worked future-feature example |

## Deliberately unavailable / remaining work

- No watch app, direct wearable-vendor authentication, cloud sync, account system or remote coaching.
- No raw motion mattress mode, unlock-history access, smart light-sleep wake, snoring classifier, apnea detection or fabricated sleep stages.
- Apple Health ZIP/XML export parsing is not implemented. The CSV and JSON formats work independently.
- Retained audio is a full bounded session, not automatically selected clips. Event summaries remain after raw retention expires. Cleanup occurs when the app next runs, not on a guaranteed background schedule.
- Diary tags are free text. Caffeine timing can be recorded in a tag/note, but there is no dedicated caffeine-dose model or exposure-adjusted statistical analysis.
- One fixed AlarmKit alarm is managed at a time; recurring wake alarms and snooze can be future features. Ordinary reminders are not an alarm fallback.
- Health samples without timezone metadata use the timezone at import; the original timezone cannot be reconstructed. Health records do not reliably label naps: classify a window through a local correction if needed.
- Source conflict resolution is deterministic, not a guarantee that the chosen source is more accurate. Very long overlapping imported records may make a day's correction affect portions on adjacent days; the editor explicitly warns about the whole selected records.
- Persistence uses atomic JSON snapshots, suitable for personal-scale history. Large histories may need a database and paged UI; safety limits prevent unbounded imports.
- Native compilation, simulator rendering, VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, device battery and all permission/interruption behavior remain unverified. See `DEVICE_TESTING.md`.
