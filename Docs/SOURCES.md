# Official sources and implementation decisions

Official documentation was reviewed on **8 November 2026** during implementation and **10 November 2026** for the Windows build/install route. Installation and compatibility must still be checked against the actual build environment, phone and signing profile.

| Background audio | [AVAudioSession recording category](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/category-swift.struct/record) | Audio background mode for locked-screen recording; interruptions still occur; app uses playAndRecord to avoid suppressing unrelated output |

The sleep-shortfall formula, energy curve, source reconciliation policy and habit summaries are **Luma implementation choices**. They are not presented as validated clinical metrics or as Apple/CDC-endorsed algorithms. The energy curve is deliberately labeled an unvalidated planning heuristic.
